# ImplementationOfAdvancedDataStructuresAndAlgorithms

This repository contains of implementations of some Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms while trying to maintain
the code quality and trying to reduce the run time to as minimum as possible. 
The written code was designed to make it generic and generalize as much as possible so that it could be reused for further problem solving 
questions.
The main aim of this type of approach is to understand the dataStructures and to have a better decission making capabilities of 
what kind of data structures to be used for any problem solving wuestion.
