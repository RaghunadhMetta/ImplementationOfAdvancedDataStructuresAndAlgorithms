This code consists of implementation of arithmetic calculations such as addition subtraction for very large numbers.
The code accepts numbers in the form of strings of any length. 



1) Num.java contains add, subtract, product, power methods of Level 1 and divide, mod, squareRoot and power methods of Level 2 and the helper methods for base conversion.


Helper functions:
1. Num(String s) : Converts String to number in desired base.
2. Num(Num num)  : Copy constructor for duplication.
3.leftShift(Num number, int numOfShifts): Performs left shift.
4.halfOf(Num a, Num one): Divides ‘a’ by 2.
5. searchQuotient(…): Searches quotient in the range of dividend.





2) LP1L1.java is a driver program where the methods of Num.java are called.


3) LP2L2.java is a driver program where the methods of Num.java are called.
